This plugin replaces the existing WordPress dashboard with an ajax homepage style of dashboard.

== Description ==

This plugin is designed to replace the existing, but limited, WordPress dashboard with a more usable, prettier and extendable version, based on the igoogle.com (www.google.com/ig) home page.

The plugin is designed so that other plugins developers can create their own gadgets using the easy API. Over time I will be building up a collection of compatible gadgets on our website.

The dashboard page can be completely "skinned" by those more artistic then myself, by simply uploading a CSS style sheet (and any associated graphics files) into the plugins skins directory.

For further details of skinning and developing add-on gadgets, please check the site at: http://dev.clearskys.net

== Installation ==

Installing this plugin should be very straightforward by following the steps below:

1. Download the plugin and un-zip it. It should create a mydashboard directory containing all of the required files
and directory structure.
2. Upload the mydashboard directory (and all sub-directories) to the plugins directory on your server, this is usually along the lines of:
root/wp-content/plugins
3. Login to your WordPress sites administration panel and go the the Plugins menu.
4. Click the activate link next to the myDashboard plugin.
5. Navigating back to the Dashboard, will now show the new dashboard.

To get the old dashboard back, simply deactivate the plugin.

This section describes how to install the plugin and get it working.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= What are the pre-requisites for installation? =

This plugin requires jQuery to be available. jQuery is available as standard on WordPress versions 2.2 and above, so ideally you should upgrade your WordPress installation to the latest versions prior to installing the myDashboard plugin. I have included a jQuery distribution with the plugin, so it "may" work with WordPress versions prior to 2.2 but it hasn't been fully tested.

= Can I create my own gadgets? =

Yes, please visit the development site at http://dev.clearskys.net for details on how to develop your own gadets.

= Will I be able to use gadgets from other platforms? =

At the moment, no. But I may try to incorporate a parser for igoogle gadgets in the near future.
